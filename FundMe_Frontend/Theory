In this we are going to create a website to interact with backend
In this we are using html , css and javascriot instead of react
and nodejs

Firstly i have too connect with metamsk so is create a function name connect in which
i wrote some limes of code with the help of metamas's websites

Note-> There is an important note that we have metamask extenshion so if we type window.ethereum tha it will not give me undefined

After connecting trhough metamask we will create a function of funding

async function fund(){
firstly we created a inmput t o get value of eth that user want to send and fetch as in the form of ethAmount

    to fund we use ethers as we used before
    we have to get provider  , signer , contract

    <!-- Provider  -->

const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);

    <!-- Signer -->

const signer = provider.getSigner();

    <!-- contract -->

const contract = new ethers.Contract(ContractAddress, abi, signer);

To get the contract we need Contract Address , ABI and signer

We got ContractAddress , ABI from backend vaya finding in attifacts

and we imported vaya creating the ethers-5.6 file and importing data form imternet
in future we will use react or node thatn it will not require to do this

}
